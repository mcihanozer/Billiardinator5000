# Billiardinator5000

Billiardinator5000 is a billiard psychics simulation developed using Java on my own as OOP course in 2012. This is the very first OOP project that I worked on.

Elastic collision is occured between the balls and accuracy of the psychics is proved with Steinhaus result [Croft and Swinnerton 1963], and Euclidâ€™s Proposition 31.
